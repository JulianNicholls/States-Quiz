# States Quiz

A Quiz about the states of the USA and their capitals.

## Two projects

There are actually two projects in this repo. The root directory is the quiz
and the [data-app](/data-app) directory contains the project that I used to
create the dates list, with the locations in the states map image, and the
names and capitals.

## Progress

Click on the answer that matches the state highlighted in Blue.

Keeps score and shows wrong answers.

**BUG**: After all 50 states, currently it crashes. There is no mystery,
it's just that there is no code dealing with it at the moment.

## Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for more than 10 years.
Over that time, I have tried many different graphical shells for Git,
without finding one that was easier and nicer to use than the command-line
(in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
